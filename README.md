# comp-neuro
This repository documents my self-driven computational neuroscience project. My goal is to combine my interests in neuroscience, CS, and electrical engineering by teaching myself theory, coding, and simple circuitry.

## File structure
- 'code/' - Python implementations of neuron models, analysis scripts, etc.
- 'datasets/' - small sample datasets for analysis
- 'figures/' - generated visualizations
- 'reflections/' - weekly thoughts, readings, and conceptual takeaways

## Current Focus
Phase 1: modeling single neurons (LIF, Hodgkin-Huxley) and analyzing spike behavior.

## My Learning Goals
- bridge neuroscience, computer science, and electrical engineering
- develop strong documentation and reproducibility practices
